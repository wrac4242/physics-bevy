# A physics simulator using bevy and verlet integration  

this project is considered finished in my eyes, but if you have any suggestions, please create an issue

## building and running

It is written in rust, so all you need to do is

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wrac4242/physics-bevy
cargo run --release
```

this builds the project in release mode and then runs it.
